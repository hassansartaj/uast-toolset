# UAS Testing Toolset
A toolset to support automated system-level testing of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The toolset utilizes model-based testing (MBT) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically generate, execute, and evaluate various test scenarios. Therefore, the toolset consists of two main modules (i) *Model Handler* responsible for handling MBT side of the approach, and (ii) *AITester* contains the implementation of AI technique for testing UAS.
